Q1) Because we already initialized the required i2c pins PB6 and PB7 in
    f3d_i2c.c
Q2) i2c1_read is a generalized form of i2c1_read_nunchuk. In the read_nunchuk variant,
    a specific register and device address are passed in to be used, an dthis is constant every time
    since the function is only being used to communicate with the nunchuk.
Q4) this gets the first 2 bits of the last element of the data array, which indicates the states of
    the two buttons. There are four possible states, both c and z pressed, both unpressed, and just
    c or just z pressed. These four states can be represented with the bits 00, 01, 10, and 11 which
    are retrieved from the data array.
