Final Project
"Journey of the Prarie King"

Description:
    This game is inspired by a mini-game in Stardew Valley. The idea is that you are the
    Prarie King, and you are trying to escape from bandits.
    The core functinality of the game is the two nunchuks. One for moving the player, the
    other for shooting the bullets.

    Task Breakdown:
    I had no partner for this, so I did everything.
