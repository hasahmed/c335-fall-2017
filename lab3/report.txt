1)
    Flash: 128kb
    Ram: 8kb
    Speed: 24Mhz

2)
    GPIO stands for General Purpose I/O (Input/Output)

4)
    Port and pin numbers of the green LED's are 15, and 11

5)
These are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef struct;

    uint32_t    GPIO_Pin
    GPIOMode_TypeDef    GPIO_Mode
    GPIOSpeed_TypeDef   GPIO_Speed
    GPIOOType_TypeDef   GPIO_OType
    GPIOPuPd_TypeDef    GPIO_PuPd

There were a few difficulites. Working in an enviornment which you are unfamiliar with is always
difficult. Learning what the code that you are givin is actually doing is difficult. It was difficult
to dicipher the f3 schematic, and I am unfamiliar with such types of documents.
Other than that the logic of trying to get the LED's to stay ON when the user was holding the button
was a bit of a challenge. But all in it seems to work well.
