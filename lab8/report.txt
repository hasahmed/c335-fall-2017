Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?
    We were able to use the nuncuck without initializing anything because the accelerometer and magnomiter are already internally wired
    to the same IO pins, the we initilize those pins in the I2C initialization functions in the I2C header file


Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?
    The major differences between the functions is that the one specific for the nunchuk has constant parameters for where it is supposed to write
    to, as well as constants to specify how many bytes that are going to be written to it. I.E. its to make sure that nunchuk isn't communicated with incorrectly.


Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk? Hint: It may be best to answer this question after the checkpoint
    


Q4) Explain the code above.
    The code reads in all of the nunchuk data, then it sets the values of n->z, and n->c according to whether or not one of them is
    pressed, or both of them are pressed, or one of them is pressed and the other is not pressed. This isformation is gathered using
    the last 2 bits of the 5th element of the overall data read form the nunchuk.
