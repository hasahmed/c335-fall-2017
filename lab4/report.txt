I have ran the analyzer one time, and am confused by the output. I didn't think that the analizer was connected to anything,
but there is still output? I have no idea what it is outputting. I will write later when I find out.
Could not get Saleae to work, and was told by the UI to move on, and we'll try to come back to it later.


There are 2 connections that a required to communicate over UART

Alternate functions for GPIO pins are required to configure the pin for something other than the
default IO function its configured to. For instance UART.


The baud rate is the rate at which symbols are transfered.

newlib_stubs is needed because when C is implemented by a compiler on an operating system, the 
compiler depends on OS specific functionality for things like reading and writing to files.
The Discovery Board does not have an operating system, and as such does not have the implemented functionality.
So we need to provide the functionality ourselfs. This is where newlib_stubs comes in. printf specifically
writes to standard output, and that is not something that is defined for our board, so we need to define it.


The logic analizer is very useful for monitoring like frequencies of components.
In the sittuation where you were unsure that would be the best form of debugging.


I learned about the UART interface, and about what it takes to implement certain c functionality on a specific platform.
The troubles that I ran into were mostly syntatical in nature. For instance I had a very difficult time figuring out
why my program was not working, when after a long while of being frustrated I found that the funciton call was preceded
by the keyword 'void' so the C compiler assumed it was a function declaration I suppose. There was no warning issued.
I hope that it is not a mistake I will make again.
