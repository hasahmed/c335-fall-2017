Lab 5 : Gyro


1) The CS pin is used to select a slave device

2) Setting the CS to high signals the end of communication with the SPI device.
   The other functions that change the CS from high to low are the read and write functions.

3) In order to hook up multiple perepherals to the same SPI bus, you would have follow all of the same
    steps, except when using the GYRO_CS_HIGH() and low macros you would need to specify the pin of
    the particular peripheral you want to communicate with.

4) The prescale value is initially set to 8. The baud rate is then 9Mhz


5) Yes the slave device does need to be configured with an initial transmition speed. You might want
    to change the transmission speed of things on the fly for things polling a device to see if it is in
    use, then if it is, up the frequncy in order to get more accurate readings from the device, if its something
    like say a gyroscope. That way there are less wasted cpu cycles for polling.

6) We learned how to communicate with a gyroscop via a SPI bus. This required writing both read and write
    functions which required that we be familiar with the SPI protocol. We ran into a number of diffuculties, the biggest
    of which was that we initialized the wrong pin, in our initialization function, which in its self wasn't a very big issue,
    but the thing is that IT WORKED at least for a little while, then stoppped seemingly out of nowhere. Then it was
    very difficult to find the source of the issue.
