Q1) The accelerometer/magnetometer comes pre-wired on the STM board. Open up the the Data Sheet and find the page with the Pin Descriptions. How many pins does it have? List the pins and their names. Next find the electrical specifications under the Electrical Characteristics section. How many volts (Vdd) are required to power the accelerometer/magnetometer? The accelerometer/magnetometer is sitting somewhere on the STM board. Try to find it and describe where it is.

    ans: The accelerometer has 14 pins. Their names are,
        1: Vdd_IO
        2: SCL
        3: SDA
        4: INT2
        5: INT1
        6: C1
        7: GND
        8: Reserved
        9: DRDY
        10: reserved
        11: Reserved
        12: SETP
        13: SETC
        14: Vdd

    ans: They both run at 2.55 volts (ideally), but they can run anywhere between 2.16, and 3.6
    ans: On the board the accelerometer is directly above the "North" LED


Q2) Why do we write to the accelerometer/magnetometer before we can read from them? What are the following lines of code doing? 
    a) Write is called before reading, because the specific slave device must be told that its going to be written to
    before writing real data to it.
    b) The lines of code from the example configure the accelerometer to behave as we would like it to. Setting things like its sensitivity
        and power consumption.


Q3) What do the following lines of code do? (it is only necessary to explain the accelerometer)
    

Q4.) Why might it be necessary to tilt compensate your compass computation?
    This is
