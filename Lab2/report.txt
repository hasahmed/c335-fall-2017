Results:

I created a word count program that works just unixs wc program, and also printed a bunch of values from a union, cast as different types, and aligned according to their size.

Difficulties:

I was unable to run gdb from my personal machine, which I had previously configured. I'm not sure what has gone wrong.
I had to push my code to git, and then clone it from silo. From there I had no problems with gdb. 

Things I learned:

I learned a few more things about make files. For one the variable names such as CLFLAGS are not just variable names that
you can call anything you want. They seem to have special meaning. I haven't found out for sure that this is the case,
but it seems to be. I also learned that an executable file compiled on silo does not run on my machine without being recompiled.
I thought this strange because they are both the same architecture. I will have to look into this further. 
I also learned that the default C standard for gcc installed on machine is std=c99, while on silo its std=c89, which leads to 
my files not compiling on silo when they do compile on my machine with the same makefile, because on my machine it isn't necessary to 
to specify that the standard is std=c99. This lead me to place the compiler flag -std=c99 in my make file so that it compiles on silo, and
my machine with no problem.
