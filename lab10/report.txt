Difficulties

The difficulties I ran into were mostly along the lines of tryig to understand how these things that i'm writing
are being read to and written to. I'm still a bit hazey on that. Other than the understanding aspects, it was also
difficult to try to make sure my implementation of the circular ques was bug-free, as it is difficult to test from
the board. Ultimatly I decided to implement the queue in another directory to make certain my implementation was correct.
