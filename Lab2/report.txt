Results:

I created a word count program that works just unixs wc program. 

Difficulties:

I was unable to run gdb from my personal machine, which I had previously configured. I'm not sure what has gone wrong.
I had to push my code to git, and then clone it from silo. From there I had no problems with gdb. 

Things I learned:

I learned a few more things about make files. For one the variable names such as CLFLAGS are not just variable names that
you can call anything you want. They seem to have special meaning. I haven't found out for sure that this is the case,
but it seems to be. I also learned that an executable file compiled on silo does not run on my machine without being recompiled.
I thought this strange because they are both the same architecture. I will have to look into this further.
